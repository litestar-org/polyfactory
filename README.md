This library offers factories for mock data generation using python type hints. It part of the LiteStar-API project and
is actively maintained by a community of maintainers and contributors.

## Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from polyfactory.factories import DataclassFactory


@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: float
    height: float
    weight: float


class PersonFactory(DataclassFactory[Person]):
    __model__ = Person


def test_is_person() -> None:
    person_instance = PersonFactory.build()
    assert isinstance(person_instance, Person)
```

That's it - with almost no work, we are able to create a mock data object fitting the Person class model definition.

This is possible because of the typing information available on the dataclass, which are used as a
source of truth for data generation.

The factory parses the information stored in the dataclass and generates a dictionary of kwargs that are passed to
the Person class constructor.

## Documentation

A full API reference and usage documentation is available in
the [dedicated documentation site](https://polyfactory.litestar.dev/).

## Installation

```shell
pip install polyfactory
```

## Relation to Pydantic-Factories

The earlier version of this library was released under the
name [pydantic-factories](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-factories/).
While this library became very popular (above 100K monthly downloads), we decided to rename it because we changed the
core architecture -
`polyfactory` is a fitting name because we no longer rely on pydantic, which is now an optional dependency. This library
is capable of
generating mock data for dataclasses, typed-dicts and any custom factory using type annotations.
It also supports using pydantic models - but that is optional.

## Contributing

This library is a community driven open source project. We welcome and encourage contributions. Please checkout the
