SQLAlchemyFactory
=================

Basic usage is like other factories

.. literalinclude:: /examples/library_factories/sqlalchemy_factory/test_example_1.py
    :caption: Declaring a factory for a SQLAlchemy model
    :language: python

.. note::
    The examples here require SQLAlchemy 2 to be installed. The factory itself supports both 1.4 and 2.


Configuration
-------------

SQLAlchemyFactory allows to override some configuration attributes so that a described factory can use a behavior from SQLAlchemy ORM such as `relationship() <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship>`_ or `Association Proxy <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/associationproxy.html#module-sqlalchemy.ext.associationproxy>`_.

Relationship
++++++++++++

By default, ``__set_relationships__`` is set to ``False``. If it is ``True``, all fields with the SQLAlchemy `relationship() <relationship()_>`_ will be included in the result created by ``build`` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/library_factories/sqlalchemy_factory/test_example_2.py
    :caption: Setting relationships
    :language: python

.. note::
    If ``__set_relationships__ = True``, ForeignKey fields associated with relationship() will be automatically generated by ``build`` method because :class:`__set_foreign_keys__ <polyfactory.factories.sqlalchemy_factory.SQLAlchemyFactory.__set_foreign_keys__>` is set to ``True`` by default. But their values will be overwritten by using ``create_sync``/ ``create_async`` methods, so SQLAlchemy ORM creates them.

.. note::
    The default for `__set_relationships__` is changed to `True` in v3. Set explicitly to retain existing behaviour.

Association Proxy
+++++++++++++++++

By default, ``__set_association_proxy__`` is set to ``False``. If it is ``True``, all SQLAlchemy fields mapped to ORM `Association Proxy <Association Proxy_>`_ class will be included in the result created by ``build`` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/library_factories/sqlalchemy_factory/test_example_association_proxy.py
    :caption: Setting association_proxy
    :language: python

.. note::
    If ``__set_association_proxy__ = True``, the Polyfactory will create both fields from a particular SQLAlchemy model (association_proxy and its relationship), but eventually a relationship field will be overwritten by using ``create_sync``/ ``create_async`` methods via SQLAlchemy ORM with a proper instance from an Association Proxy relation.

.. note::
    The default for `__set_association_proxy__` is changed to `True` in v3. Set explicitly to retain existing behaviour.


Persistence
-----------

A handler is provided to allow persistence. This can be used by setting ``__session__`` attribute on a factory.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/library_factories/sqlalchemy_factory/test_example_3.py
    :caption: Using persistence
    :language: python

By default, this will add generated models to the session and then commit. This can be customised further by setting ``__sync_persistence__``.

Similarly for ``__async_session__`` and ``create_async``.


Adding global overrides
-----------------------

By combining the above and using other settings, a global base factory can be set up for other factories.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/library_factories/sqlalchemy_factory/test_example_4.py
    :caption: Using persistence
    :language: python


Add column type mapping
-----------------------

Columns types and normally automatically mapped to Python type. This can be overridden for cases where Python type is not available or need to provide extra information to correctly generate.
