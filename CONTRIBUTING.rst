Contributing
==================

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

1. Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_.
2. Run ``poetry install --extras full`` to create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
   and install the dependencies.
3. If you're working on the documentation and need to build it locally, install the extra dependencies with ``poetry
   install --with docs --extras full``.
4. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.
5. Run ``pre-commit install`` to install pre-commit hooks.

Code contributions
------------------

Workflow
++++++++

1. `Fork <https://github.com/litestar-org/polyfactory/fork>`_ the upstream repository and clone the fork locally.
2. Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_, and install the project's dependencies with ``poetry install --extras full``.
3. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ by running ``pre-commit install``.
4. Make whatever changes and additions you wish and commit these - please try to keep your commit history clean.
   1. .. note:: 100% tests are mandatory.
5. Once you are ready, add a PR in the main repo.
6. Create a pull request to the main repository with an explanation of your changes. The title should follow the `conventional commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ convention.


Project documentation
---------------------

The documentation is located in the ``/docs`` directory and is built with `ReST <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_
and `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. If you're unfamiliar with any of those,
`ReStructuredText primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ and
`Sphinx quickstart <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/quickstart.html>`_ are recommended reads.

Docs theme and appearance
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the appearance and usability of the docs. We use a custom theme that
inherits the `PyData Sphinx Theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which comes
with a lot of options out of the box. If you wish to contribute to the docs style / setup, or static site generation,
you should consult the theme docs as a first step.

Running the docs locally
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To run or build the docs locally, you need to first install the required dependencies:

``poetry install --with docs --extras full``

Then you can serve the documentation with ``make docs-serve``, or build them with ``make docs``

Writing and editing docs
++++++++++++++++++++++++

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the content of the docs. Feel free to add examples, clarify text,
restructure the docs etc., but make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Write text in idiomatic english, using simple language
- Keep examples simple and self contained
- Provide links where applicable
- Use `intersphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/lib/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_ wherever possible when
  referencing external libraries
- Provide diagrams using `mermaidjs <https://mermaid.js.org/>`_ where applicable and possible

2. Increment the version in `pyproject.toml <pyproject.toml>`_
3. Commit and push.
4. In GitHub go to the `releases tab <https://github.com/litestar-org/polyfactory/releases>`_
5. Pick "`Draft a new release <https://github.com/litestar-org/polyfactory/releases/new>`_"
6. Give it a title and a tag, both ``vX.X.X``
7. Fill in the release description, you can let GitHub do it for you and then edit as needed.
8. Publish the release.
